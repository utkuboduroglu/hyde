# Hey there!
I am Utku, a math major @ METU and a member of METU Racing Driverless, and this is my personal blog for self-documenting. I don't really have a rule on what I upload here, but my interests are math/CS related, so most of my content will probably be relevant to that.

If I'm making any progress with programming projects, they will most likely be hosted on [my github page](https://github.com/utkuboduroglu). Currently, I'm working on:

* Writing a [simple http server](https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/simple-http-server) in C++ (and hopefully Rust in the future).
* Working on a tabletop RPG.
